### Notes
Run the following command to compile all the necessary files:
```
./compile.sh <executable_name>
```
**Compile.sh and all .c files must be located in the same directory!**

**You must have bash and gcc installed for this command to run!**

After running that command above, you can run the program using the name you used in that command.
